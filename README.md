# TravelDiscovery
This repository was created following the tutorial that you can find in [Letsbuildthatapp](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/courses/SwiftUI%20Mastery%20Travel%20Discovery) web page.
It was rewritten by me, refactoring some files, avoiding boilerplate code, following best practices and adding new features that in the tutorial you are not going to find.
If you want to see how it was written you can visit the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/AlejandroRoblesA/TravelDiscovery/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) created for this repository.
